# Leetcode-Solutions

Welcome to the **Leetcode-Solutions** repository! This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. Each solution is carefully crafted to achieve optimal performance, considering both time and space complexity.



## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
├── 1-two-sum
│   ├── README.md
│   └── two-sum.java
├── 11-container-with-most-water
│   ├── README.md
│   └── container-with-most-water.py
└── ...
```

### Each directory contains:
- **README.md** (where available): Provides a brief description of the problem and the approach taken to solve it.
- **Solution file**: The actual code implementation, which may be in different programming languages depending on the problem.

## Key Metrics

For each solution, performance metrics are included where possible:
- **Time Complexity**: Execution time measured in milliseconds (ms).
- **Memory Usage**: Memory consumption measured in megabytes (MB).

These metrics are listed in the format:
```
Time: XX ms (YY.XX%) | Memory: ZZ.Z MB (WW.WW%) - LeetSync
```

Where:
- '**XX ms**' is the execution time.
- '**YY.XX%**' is the percentile rank based on the execution time.
- '**ZZ.Z MB**' is the memory used.
- '**WW.WW%**' is the percentile rank based on memory usage.

## Usage

Feel free to browse through the solutions. To run a solution, navigate to the respective directory and execute the provided program file. Each solution is designed to be self-contained and does not require any external dependencies.

## Contributions

While this repository is primarily for my personal reference, I welcome any suggestions for optimization or alternative approaches. If you have a better solution or an improvement to one of the existing solutions, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
